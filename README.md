## **Description of Refactor Issues**

### Horiseon's webpage code needed adjustments to improve code syntax and structure, fix links, and meet accessibility standards.

## **Motivation**

### Clean and legible code and comments allow for easier trouble shooting. Improved accessibility allows for users with disabilities, who employ tools such as screen readers to get the most out of their website experience. Accessibility also allows our website to be prioritized by search engines such as google, which encourages website traffic, and it helps avoid legal litigation.

## **Corrections**

- Added correct and descriptive tab title
- Changed div to header element
- Changed div to nav element
- Changed div to section element
- Changed div to article element
- Added id for search-engine-optimization to fix link
- Added alt attributes for each picture
- Changed div to aside element
- Added blank alt attributes for unimportant icon pictures
- Changed div to footer element
