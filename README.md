# Horiseon

## Description of Refactor Issues

### Horiseon's webpage's code needed asjustements to improve code syntax and structure, fix links, and meet accessibility standards.

## Motivation

### Clean and legible code and comments allow for easier trouble shooting. Improved accessibility allows for users with disabilities, who employ tools such as screen readers to get the most out of their website experience. Accessibility also allows our website to be prioritized by search engines such as google, which encourages website traffic, and it helps avoid legal litigation.
